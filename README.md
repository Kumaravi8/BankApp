# 💼 Internship Task 5 — Bank Account Simulation

This is a **Java-based CLI (Command Line Interface)** project developed as part of **Task 5** under the **Elevate Labs Internship Program**.

It simulates basic bank operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
All operations like deposit, withdraw, view balance, and transaction history are implemented in a modular, layered architecture.
